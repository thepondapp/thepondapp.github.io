            Welcome to The Pond and a new world of data-backed networking! <br><br>

            We want you to know the terms and conditions that apply to everyone using The Pond - things you need to know such as (a) that The Pond is offered on an “AS-IS” basis with no warranties, (b) that The Pond is currently a beta version that we are still testing (with input from users such as you!), and (c) much else besides, so keep reading.  <br><br>

            We reserve the right to change our Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy from time to time. <br><br>

            We encourage you to visit thepond.app/terms at least once a month to see if there are any such changes.<br><br>

            We do not use cookies or any other means to capture and retain information that you do not expressly and deliberately provide us.<br/><br/>
            Currently the only default information The Pond receives from you is the information you provide when setting up an account. Our servers receive information about the IP address from which you access The Pond, which may or may not identify you personally depending on what devices you use to access The Pond. <br/><br/>
            To the extent we maintain any such personal data on The Pond’s systems, we will encrypt it.<br/><br/>
            If you contact us by email, we will not make your email address available to other persons and entities; we will use it only to respond to your email and any issue you raise with us by email.<br/><br/>

            We follow data minimization practices so as to receive from you and use and retain only data that are relevant and necessary to the purposes of your use of The Pond.<br/><br/>
            We do not engage in advertising products and services other than The Pond, and we do not allow other persons and entities unaffiliated with The Pond to advertise to The Pond users.<br/><br/>
            We use and process information we receive from you only for the purpose of enabling your use of The Pond, providing relevant information to the users you are matched with, and our operation and improvement of The Pond.<br/><br/>
            We may perform studies of information that includes information we receive from you, and we may give access to agents and contractors of The Pond for that limited purpose, which includes purposes of public interest, scientific and historical value, and research and statistical study.<br/><br/>
            We may aggregate information, use it for internal The Pond studies, and share it in anonymized form with other persons and entities.<br/><br/>
            Any links to other websites in connection to The Pond do not constitute endorsements of any aspect of such websites and The Pond assumes no responsibility for their actions.<br/><br/>

            The Pond will provide information pursuant to lawful regulatory actions and legal processes such as subpoenas, and we reserve the right to resist requests for information that our legal counsel concludes are contrary to or beyond the requirements of applicable law.<br/><br/>
            We do not sell or license your information to persons or entities unaffiliated with The Pond.<br/><br/>
            We do not ask The Pond users for credit card information, financial account information, or other such information that could be effectively targeted by hackers.<br/><br/>
